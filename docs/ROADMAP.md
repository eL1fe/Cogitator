## Key Decisions

### Already Decided

- TypeScript-first (not Python)
- Self-hosted-first (cloud optional)
- Monorepo with pnpm
- Docker for sandboxing
- Postgres + Redis for persistence

### To Be Decided

- [x] M2: Primary embedding model (OpenAI vs local) — Both supported via EmbeddingService
- [x] M4: Workflow DSL syntax — WorkflowBuilder fluent API
- [x] M6: MCP vs custom tool protocol — Both supported via @cogitator-ai/mcp package
- [ ] M8: Kubernetes operator vs Helm-only
- [ ] M10: Cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Fly.io)
